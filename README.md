# Sony-Bravia-Remote
Remote Control of Sony Bravia TV over HTTP

Just browse to http://deanrather.github.io/Sony-Bravia-Remote/, put in your TV's IP, and start using it.

## Troubleshooting

Debug information can be found in the debug console (`F12`).

Some models require a different API endpoint, check out the URL's at the bottom of the index.html.

This works for my `SONY BRAVIA KDL-60EX720`

## TODO:

- make `Power On` work
- make `Power Off` work
- make default IP passable as a GET variable
- make HDMI names passable as a GET variable
